# Webcrawlers

2 files are a demonstration of webcrawlers. 
For the ipynb file, it shows a method of scraping websites built from shopify. 
It reads the /link/product.json?limit=x and parses the info into JSON files. 

For the py file, it demonstrates a method of scraping using the Scrapy library. 
Follow the documentation and tutorial from the Scrapy website: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html.
The idea behind webscraping with Scrapy was to try a different method of webscraping, as opposed to using the Request and BeautifulSoup libraries.
